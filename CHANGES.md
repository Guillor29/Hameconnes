- Updated browser tab title in `app.blade.php`
- Updated site header title in `NavigationMenu.vue`
- Updated login page title and heading

## 2. Implemented Login Requirement for Main Page

- Moved the main route (`/`) into the `middleware('auth')` group in `web.php`

## Testing

2. Log in with admin credentials (email: guillaume.rv29@gmail.com, password: azerty)
3. After login, you should see the main page
4. Verify "Les HameÃ§onnÃ©s ðŸŽ£" appears in browser tab and navigation
